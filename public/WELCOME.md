### The Philosophy 💡

We believe that knowledge shouldn't be gated, hidden, or hard to find. University life is tough enough without having to hunt down that one specific past paper or lecture note. **Linear** exists to remove those barriers. It's about a straight line from *needing* help to *finding* help. No detours.
